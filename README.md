# What is this?

This is a demo API written using Laravel, to run in a Docker environment, and is meant to be consumed by
the frontend project called `music-society-frontend`. As it is still a WIP there are many gaps
in functionality that will be addressed in the future.

The purpose of this API is to administer a music library management system
for schools and community music organizations, where scores are generally purchased by
the school or nonprofit and reused over subsequent years. The application will support:
* basic CRUD functions
* hosting digital versions of individual pieces
* user management, including security around which piece(s) a user is able to download
* basic reporting on incomplete pieces, checkout history, ensemble registration, etc.
